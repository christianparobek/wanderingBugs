=============

A repository for msBWT applications.

####Projects in this directory:

- **compareRefKmers** - If we can find species-specific kmers, we could whole-genome-amplify our pathogen of choice out of contaminating DNA (e.g. human, mosquito).
- **dupFinder** - Compare isolates of the same species to look for duplication differences.
